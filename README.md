Cyberlab is split into two parts. The frontend, where users log in, launch labs, and track progress. The Daemon, which is what manages Apache Guacamole, QEMU/KVM, Sessions, and is where your courses reside. 
You can have multiple daemons with different courses to help balance load. More will be comming soon.
